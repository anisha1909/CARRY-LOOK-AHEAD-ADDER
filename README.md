# CARRY-LOOK-AHEAD-ADDER


A **Carry-Lookahead Adder** is a type of adder used in digital circuits to perform binary addition at high speed. Unlike ripple-carry adders, which compute carry sequentially, the CLA computes carry signals in parallel using **generate** and **propagate** logic, reducing the overall delay.

#### Key Features:
1. **Generate (G)**: Indicates if a bit pair will generate a carry.
   - \( G = A. B \)

2. **Propagate (P)**: Indicates if a bit pair will propagate a carry.
   - \( P = A + B\)

3. **Carry Calculation**: Carries are calculated in parallel using the formula:
   - \( C_1 = G + (P. C) \)

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - \( S= P^C \)

#### Advantages:
- **Faster Operation**: Computes carries in parallel, reducing delay.
- **Efficient for Large Numbers**: Better performance for multi-bit addition compared to ripple-carry adders.

#### Applications:
- Used in processors, ALUs, and digital systems requiring fast addition operations.
